This is a single page web-based application that allows users to manage their tasks. The app features the
ability to add, remove, rename, and mark tasks as completed, as well as display all, active, or completed tasks. The app
also includes a feature to switch between dark and light themes, as well as a login/authentication flow to protect user

The application is connected to a real server, which allows for seamless data management and storage.
